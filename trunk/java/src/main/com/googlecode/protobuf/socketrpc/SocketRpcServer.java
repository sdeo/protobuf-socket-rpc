/**
 * Socket server for running RPC services. It can serve requests for any
 * registered service from any client who is using a
 * {@link SocketRpcConnectionFactory}.
 * <p>
 * Note that this server can only handle synchronous requests, so if the service
 * implementation does not invoke the callback in the same thread, no response
 * will be sent back to the client.
 *
 * @deprecated Use {@link RpcServer} with
 *             {@link SocketServerRpcConnectionFactory} instead.
