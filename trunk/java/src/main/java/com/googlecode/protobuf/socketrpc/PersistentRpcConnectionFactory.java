 * An {@link RpcConnectionFactory} that uses a single {@link Connection} to send

 * it sends RPCs serially if multiple threads try to send RPCs at the same time.
 * i.e. Any threads that make RPCs while one is currently in progress will be
 * blocked until previous RPCs complete. Also note that it does not guarantee
 * the order in which requests will be sent or received, therefore non-blocking
 * RPCs might not send and receive messages in any predictable order.
 * <p>
 * Also, since only a single {@link Connection} is used for all RPCs, the
 * {@link #close()} method must explicitly be called when the client has
 * finished using the factory.
 * <p>
 * If used with {@link SocketRpcConnectionFactories}, only delimited connection
 * factories can be used.
