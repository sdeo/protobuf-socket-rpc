DESCRIPTION = """Google's protocol buffer library makes writing rpc services
easy, but it does not contain a rpc implementation. The transport details are
left up to the user to implement.

This is a simple tcp/ip socket based rpc implementation in java and python for
people who want a simple implementation of their protobuf rpc services.
