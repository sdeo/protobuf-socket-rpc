'''run_client.py - An example client using the python socket implementation of
the Google Protocol Buffers.

This module is an executable script demonstrating the usage of the python socket
implementation of the Google Protocol Buffers. To work correctly, the script
requires a server to be running first (i.e. run_server.py).
