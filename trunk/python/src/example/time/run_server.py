'''run_server.py - An example server using the python socket implementation of
the Google Protocol Buffers.

This module is an executable script demonstrating the usage of the python socket
implementation of the Google Protocol Buffers. This script starts a socket
server running on localhost:8090. Once running, the run_client.py script can 
be used to test the TimeService.getTime remote procedure call (RPC).
