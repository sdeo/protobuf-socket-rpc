Version 1.3.2 (SVN Revision 89) 2010-11-04

* Use a more pythonic directory structure to allow better use of
  setuptools/distribute features
* Add metadata to setup.py
* Rename Python module from protobuf to protobuf.socketrpc to avoid
  name clashes
* Join thread instead of busy waiting for synchronous calls
* Protobuf 2.3.0 compatible
* Fixes for Issue 11 (Cannot create different server side handlers for
  the same service) and Issue 12 (Exceptions on server not propogated
  to client)
* Fixed unit tests

Version 1.3.1 (SVN Revision 46) 2009-12-21

* Added Service class to make rpc calls cleaner and hide some of the
  setup details

Version 1.3 (SVN Revision 33) 2009-10-04

* Protobuf 2.2.0 compatible and dependent.
* Moving error reasons out of response message into its own top level
  type in the proto. Added client side error reasons to the error
  codes to be consistent.

Version 1.2 (SVN Revision 12) 2009-02-14

* Errors that occur on server side are not relayed back to
  client. Client has new error reasons for them in the controller.
* Client callback behavior is faithful replication of server callback
  scenarios:
  - Callback is called with good response.
  - Callback is not called.
  - Callback is called with null.
  - Callback is called with empty protocol buffer.
* Added comprehensive unit tests for client and server.

Version 1.1 (SVN Revision 9) 2009-02-06

* Added error handling. When errors occur, the client can find out
  what error occurred from the controller.
* Started adding unit tests.
